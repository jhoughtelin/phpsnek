# PHP Battlesnake Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a high-performance PHP Battlesnake implementation. The design focuses on modularity, performance optimization, and strategic decision-making to create a competitive snake that can win most battles.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Web Server Layer**
   - Handles incoming webhook requests from the Battlesnake game engine
   - Routes requests to appropriate handlers
   - Manages response formatting and timing

2. **Game State Manager**
   - Parses incoming game state from requests
   - Maintains board representation
   - Tracks snake positions, food, and hazards

3. **Decision Engine**
   - Evaluates possible moves
   - Implements pathfinding algorithms
   - Applies strategic rules and heuristics
   - Selects optimal move

4. **Strategy Components**
   - Food-seeking behavior
   - Survival tactics
   - Opponent avoidance
   - Space control
   - Aggressive tactics

5. **Utility Services**
   - Pathfinding implementations (A*, Dijkstra's)
   - Flood fill analysis
   - Distance calculations
   - Board state evaluation

## Request Flow

1. **Incoming Request**
   - Request arrives at `public/index.php`
   - Router determines appropriate controller

2. **Controller Processing**
   - Controller validates request
   - Parses game state
   - Initializes required services

3. **Game State Analysis**
   - Board state is constructed
   - Current situation is analyzed

4. **Strategy Selection**
   - StrategySelector evaluates current state
   - Chooses appropriate strategy based on game phase and conditions

5. **Move Calculation**
   - Selected strategy calculates possible moves
   - Pathfinding algorithms find optimal paths
   - Flood fill evaluates space availability
   - Moves are scored based on multiple factors

6. **Response Generation**
   - Best move is selected
   - Response is formatted and returned
   - Timing information is logged

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management

- Use primitive arrays where possible for board representation
- Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
- Minimize object creation during critical path calculations

### Computation Efficiency

- Cache results of expensive calculations
- Implement early termination in search algorithms
- Use iterative deepening for time-constrained operations
- Prioritize critical calculations and use fallbacks if time runs short

### Concurrency

- Maintain stateless design to handle multiple games
- Use game ID for request isolation
- Implement proper error handling to prevent crashes

## Strategic Decision Making

The decision engine will use a weighted scoring system that considers:

1. **Immediate Safety**
   - Avoid collisions with walls, other snakes, and self
   - Evaluate space availability after move

2. **Food Acquisition**
   - Calculate paths to nearest food
   - Consider health level when prioritizing food

3. **Space Control**
   - Prefer moves that maximize available space
   - Avoid moves that lead to enclosed areas

4. **Opponent Interaction**
   - Avoid head-to-head collisions with larger snakes
   - Pursue head-to-head collisions with smaller snakes
   - Cut off opponents' paths when advantageous

5. **Long-term Planning**
   - Consider future board states
   - Evaluate potential opponent moves
   - Plan multi-step sequences when possible

## Configuration System

The snake will include a configuration system that allows adjusting:

- Strategy weights
- Pathfinding parameters
- Timeout thresholds
- Logging verbosity
- Appearance customization

This will facilitate experimentation and tuning without code changes.

## Logging and Debugging

- Implement comprehensive logging
- Track timing of critical operations
- Log decision factors and scores
- Support debug mode with detailed output

## Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling
- Ensure fallback moves are always available
- Prevent timeouts by monitoring execution time
- Gracefully handle unexpected game states

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core algorithms
- Integration tests for end-to-end behavior
- Performance benchmarks
- Scenario-based tests for specific game situations

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a high-performance PHP Battlesnake that can be extended and refined over time.
